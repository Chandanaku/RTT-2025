###### Implementation

1. Used Type annotaions for the objects, functions and for the mapped functions
2. import, export keywords used for making the code modular and reusable
3. wote async code for the apiservices
4. wrote customized error functions
5. Tried to implement the encapsulation for the product class ,error functions implemented using the inheritence,abstarction is used in calculating tax and polymorphism is not implemented.

###### challenges

1.incorporating oops concepts to the code and in the type returns  
2. with async functionsface faced unexpected behavior that behavior overcomed by including try/catch

3. async/await are used to achieve asynchronous operations.
4. failed responses loged as errors using error functions with the help of Math.random and setout function
